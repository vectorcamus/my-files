Odisha can be divided into **three** broad regions. 
> 1. **==The coastal plains==**
> 2. **==The middle mountainous country==**
> 3. **==The plateaus and rolling uplands.==** 

## 1. Coastal Plains

* Subarnarekha in the north-east to the Rushikulya in the south-west.
* **~6 major river~**
  * **From north to south,** the Subamarekha, the Burhabalanga, the Baitarani, the Brahmani, the Mahanadi and the Rushikulya.
  * **In order of the contribution** of the rivers to the formation of the coastal plains, the rivers may be rearranged as the Mahanadi, the Brahmani, the Baitarani, the Subarnarekh, the Rushikulya and the Burhabalanga.
* most of the rivers have **~failed to develop true deltaic characteristics~** (as far as shape is concerned) because of the strong offshore current which moves from Chennai to the Andhra coast and passes through the Odisha coast.
  * combined deltas of the Brahmani and the Baitarani are **fairly stable** in contrast to that of the Mahanadi where the free delta formation is restricted by the strong littoral current from the south-west.
  * The delta development of the Brahmani is also **obliterated by the encroachment of the distributaries** of the Mahanadi and the Baitarani from the south and the north respectively

**The coastal plains can be divided into the following sub-regions:** 
> 
> 1. ==The north coastal plains--the deltas of the Subarnarekha and the Burhabalanga up to the river Baitarani;==
> 2. ==The middle coastal plains--the combined deltas of the Baitarani, the Brahmani and the Mahanadi;==
> 3. ==The southern coastal plains--the Rushikulya plains==

**The configuration of the coastal plain is concerned, it can be divided into three zones parallel to the shoreline:**

> 1. ==The salt tract along the coast== 
> 2. ==The arable tract or rice country in the middle==
> 3. ==The submontane tract to the west.== 

==**The Salt Tract:**==

* 4.8 to 9.6 km inland.
* impregnated with salt and is completely deprived of agriculture.
* area difficult to traverse
* sand ridges which often rise up to 16-26 metres
  * formed due to the recession of the sea as a result of coastal upliftment.
* 'Little Sunderbans' off Paradeep- Dhamra coast.
* In the Devi-Daya sector, Casuarina forests+ plantations

==**The Arable Tract:**==

* grass belt merges into the vast plains where ~**monotony of orography**~ is a special feature
  * Except the old abandoned high ridges of old and **moribund rivers,** no other highlands are encountered 
  * mostly these are occupied by village sites so as to be free from the ~annual inundation~
* rivers have formed levees
* the richest part of the whole of Odisha as far as agriculture is concerned.

==**The Submontane Tract**==

* the meeting zone of the arable tract and the spurs of the Eastern Ghats (***zone of transition***)
* Hill streams of various sizes have cut deep ravines along the foothills of the Eastern Ghats
  * Hence , soil erosion is rampant.
* predominantly red soil are blocks of laterite are buried and at times they crop up to the surface, turning the area barren and desolate zone
  * low level laterites are formed.
* patches of fertile area are not uncommon, having rich vegetation.
* prickly thorns and stunted shrubs to Sal (Shorea robusta) forests.
* somewhat less conspicuous in the Rushikulya plains
* The absence of a coastal forest belt is most striking.

**The Mahanadi Delta:**

* has developed in seven different stages. 
  * After the seventh stage of delta development there was an **upliftment**, as a result of which three sets of parallel sand-dunes developed along the coast
  * These parallel sand-dunes have the maximum development between the Chilika and the Devi mouth and from there up to the north of Dhamra.
  * entire coastline has become a prograded coast as a consequence, except Paradeep, the river mouths have been choked and this hinders the free discharge of flood water.
  * Due to the upliftment of the mouth portions, the slope of the valley long-profiles have been reduced and free discharge of flood water has been hindered.

* Several lagoons of varied sizes have been formed. The best examples are the **Sar Pata** and the **Samagara Pata,** located to the north of Puri. 

**The Coastline:**

* 529 km from the marshes of Ichhapuram in the south to the east of Subarnarekha in the north-east (NE).
* Odisha coast has bulged out in the middle.
* portion from Brahmagiri on Chilika lake in the south-west (SW) to Chandbali in the north-north-east (NE) where the Mahanadi, the Brahmani and the Baitarani have formed a combined delta
* coast is convex to the Bay of Bengal while from Chandbali to the Subarnarekha mouth it is concave as no major river has pushed the shoreline to the Bay of Bengal
* recent delta formation in the Post-Tertiary period in the middle portion
* In the coastline all the signs of a prograded coast become quite obvious. 
  * The bay-bars in the mouth of the Chilika lake, in the Devi mouth and to the left bank of the Mahanadi mouth are the best examples
* In the Mahanadi mouth, the complex-spit with a number of hooks is formed due to the offshore long current and the strong south-west monsoon current during the rainy season when the load discharge in the Mahanadi is the maximum.
* The daily high and low tides have kept the mouths of the Devi, the Mahanadi, the Brahmani and the Baitarani open to form estuaries. 

**The Lakes, Lagoons and Marshes**

* **artificial lakes** was very limited as only two reservoirs were in existence in the upper catchment basin of the Rushikulya, one at Sorada and the other at Bhanjanagar.
* The other freshwater artificial reservoirs were formed at Cuttack by the construction of anicuts over the Mahanadi at Naraj and Jobra and one on the Birupa
* the Hirakud, again over the Mahanadi at Sambalpur and Machhakund over the river by the same name.
* most important reservoirs 
  * Balimela on the river Sileru;
  * Rengali over the Brahmani;
  * Mandira over the Sankh, a tributary to the Brahmani near Rourkela;
* upper Indravati in the river indravati
* medium irrigation projects like the one at Hadagarh over the Salandi and the Poteru dam over the river Potteru.

**Chilika lake**

* 72 km long (north to south) of which the northern half has a mean breadth of 32 km, while the southern half tapers into an irregularly carved point barely averaging 8 km in width.
* lake fluctuates in different seasons
  * During dry weather, it approximates to 891 sq. km. whereas with the intensity and duration of the annual river floods, and with the ebb and flow of tides its area extends to 1,165 sq. km.
* edge in the Eastern Ghats which bring a huge amount of silt to the lake from the west.
* The deepest part of the lake is at Kalijai.
* birds from as far as Siberia migrate to this lake during winter
* The salt content of the lake diminishes during the monsoons and increases during winter.
* It has an outlet (100 metres) to the Bay of Bengal.
* Keeping the outlet open poses problems because of the offshore current. 

**Other lakes**
* The lake Anusupa is another freshwater lake on the left bank of the Mahanadi opposite Banki in Cuttack district.
  * It is, in fact, an old ox-bow lake which was formed due to meander shifting of the Mahanadi.
* There is a marsh, viz., Udyanakhanda, on the coast at Ichhapur on the border of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh whose water is brackish.
* The Sar lake, the Samagara pata and the Tampara are only three old lagoons initially cut-off from the Bay of Bengal.
* The artificial Nua Nai cut in the Sar lake by the Irrigation Department has reduced floods in the region. 
**Bays and Islands** 
* a built-up coast or prograded coast and in parts has been uplifted, the absence of bays and inlets is conspicuous.
* Only one bay, Hukitola bay, off Jambu, has been formed because of the huge complex-spit formed to the north of the Mahanadi estuary.
* ~depositional islands~
  * They are the Shortt's Island and Wheeler Islands off Maipura and Dhamra Mouths a few kilometres inside the Bay of Bengal.
* These two islands will also merge in due course as the Mahanadi delta advances by continuous silting. They will then form part of the mainland. 
**Natural Harbours** 
* Paradeep.
* Chandbali and Gopalpur are being developed as medium ports
* Dhamra is a minor fishing port.
## 2. Middle Mountainous Country 

* about three-fourths of the entire State
* part of the Indian Peninsula and sloped from the west to the east prior to the upliftment of the Eastern Ghats
* lines of drainage which are older than the Eastern Ghats were consequent streams which followed the grain of the country by maintaining a north-west-north (NWN) to south-east-south (SES) direction was maturedly eroded 
* well-developed drainage system on a slightly undulated Archaean surface, subsequent to the Lower Gondwana deposits, to the north-west of Cuttack
* During the Permo-Car- boniferous period, the region along the eastern coast of India, extending from Chota Nagpur plateau, Kendujhar, Dhenkanal, parts of Sambalpur, Phulabani, northern Ganjam, Kalahandi and Koraput districts underwent a tectonic upliftment
* Consequently, the old matured surface was elevated to a height of 300 metres.
* Almost all the major rivers of Odisha could withstand the storm and main- tained their north-north west (NNW) to south-south-east (SSE) course.
  * This is mainly because all the streams have cut through the 300 metres contour line effectively.
* Most probably before this upliftment the tributaries of the Mahanadi with south-west (SW) or north-east (NE) or vice versa alignment were not in existence. This uplifted plateau began to be deeply eroded in the rejuvenated long-profiles.
* This region also underwent another two crustal upliftments which elevated the older surface first to 600 metres, and then to 900 metres. 
* The river peneplains were uplifted to 300 metres and 600 metres. This resulted in sharp watershed in the heart of Odisha which cut off many of the old rivers from their headwaters, while a few major rivers like the Brahmani and the Mahanadi could cope with the upliftment and maintained their old cours- es intact.
* They have cut right through 600-900 metres contour lines, and the presence of gorge at Satkosia in the Mahanadi and very deep valleys in the upper Brahmani to the north of Deogarh bear ample evidence to this supposition
* The beheaded rivers are the Burhabalanga, the Baitarani, the Rushikulya, the Vamsadhara and the Nagavali
* After upliftment, the ib and the Tel, all tributaries of the Mahanadi, came into existence on the western slopes of the Eastern Ghats which followed the direction of upliftment.
* The headwaters of the Baitarani was cap- tured by the Koel, a tributary to the Brahmani, flowing in North-East-South-West (NESW) direction.

* The Tel, tributary of the Mahanadi, captured the headwaters of the Rushikulya, the Vamasadhara and the Nagavali rivers. It flowed in a SW to NE direction, and met the Mahanadi at Sonapur. Hence, the Tel, the lb, the Koel and Sarkh are of later origin than all the major rivers mentioned above.
* The Eastern Ghats were uplifted in three succesive stages instead of two, as advocated by the Geological Survey of India, or there was a sufficiently long interval between the last two stages to be considered as a separate stage. 
* The three-upliftment-hypothesis has been advo- cated by drawing cross-sections along the interfluves of the major rivers of Odisha and also at right angles to the present lines of drainage system

**The Middle Mountainous Region morphologically can be divided into the following regions of second order:**

> 1. ==The Similipal and Meghasani mountain== 
> 
> 2. ==The Mankarnacha-Malayagiri and Gandhamardar moun- tains of the Baitarani and the Brahmani interfluve== 
> 
> 3. ==The watershed between the Brahmani and the Mahanadi==
> 
> 4. ==The common interfluve of the Mahanadi, the Rushikulya and the Vamsadhara== 
> 
> 5. ==The Potangi and Chandragiri mountain ranges.==

==**(a)The Similipal and Meghasani mountain**==

* dome-shaped mountain
* volcanic origin
* 600 metres to 1,050 metres above mean sea level (MSL)
* almost circular in extensio
* two peaks,
  * one at Similipal and the other at Meghasani (1,147 metres).
* radial pattern of drainage

==**(b) The Mankarnacha-Malayagiri and Gandhamnardan moun- tains of the Baitarani and Brahmani interfluve**== 

* three lofty peaks extends in a north-south (NS) direction.
  * Malayagiri (1,170 metres) of Pala-Lahara, Mankarnacha of Banei (1,092 metres) and Gandhamardan (1,044 metres) of Kendujhar
- a part of the Eastern Ghats whose original trend is NE to SW.
* The present NS direction of this group of mountains is due to the continuous fluvial action of the Baitarani and the Brahmani.
* polycyclic region. 

==**(c) Watershed between the Brahmani and the Mahanadi**==

* more maturedly dissected by continued action of the Mahanadi and the Brahmani.
* higher erosive capacity compared to the other rivers of Odisha has reduced these mountains to only 600 metres
* mountains is NW in the norther portion, and NNW to SSE in the southern portion. 

==**(d) The Common interfluve of the Mahanadi, the Rushikulya and the Vamsadhara**== 

* deeply eroded
* from 600 to 1000 metres in elevation.
* This interfluve stretches in a north- south direction with several peaks rising above 1,200 metres. 
* Amongst them Singaraju and Mahendragiri (above 1,500 metres) and Devagiri (1,360 metres)

==**(e) The Potangi and Chandragiri mountain ranges**== 

* mountain ranges are the highest in Odisha
* the average height varies from 900 to 1,350 metres
* The first five highest peaks in the Eastern Ghats are encountered in these mountains, all of which are above 1,500 metres.
* Galikonda (1,643 metres)
* Sinkaram (1,620 metres)
* Turiakonda (1,598 metres).
* The original trend of the Eastern Ghats is still preserved in this section, since it runs in a NE to SW direction.
* mountains completely separate the Nagavali and the Sabari basins.

## 3. Plateaus and Rolling Uplands

* elevation of 300-600 metres
* peninsular tablelands.
* almost flat and the monoto- ny of orography is interrupted by the deep river valleys.
* commonly met within the upper Baitarani and the Sabari basins of Kendujhar and Koraput districts respectively.
* In these plateaus, sheet erosion is met while gullying is confined to the river valleys

**Morphologically divided into the following divisions of the second order** 

> 1. ==The Panposh-Kendujhar-Pala Lahara plateau of the upper Baitarani catchment basin.== 
> 
> 2. ==The Nabarangapur-Jaypur plateau of the upper Sabari basin.==
---
* The rolling uplands are lower in elevation and they vary between 150 and 300 metres.
* uplands are the products of river action and are flat in nature.
* are rich in soil nutrients and afford good opportunities for cultivation of paddy in wet areas. 
* uplands are encountered within the Koel-Sankh basin of Upper Brahmani, in the lb, the Suktel and the Sabari basins.
* All these uplands have developed to the west of the Eastern Ghats.

**The rolling uplands are grouped into the follow- ing morphological units:** 

> 1. ==The Rajgangpur-Panposh uplands of the Koel and the Sankh rivers==
> 
> 2. ==The Jharsuguda uplands of the lb basin==
> 
> 3. ==The Baragarh uplands of the Jira and the Jhaun basins== 
> 
> 4. ==The Balangir-Titilagarh-Patnagarh uplands of northern Tel basin== 
> 
> 5. ==The Bhawanipatna uplands of the southern Tel basin==
> 
> 6. ==The Malkangiri uplands of the Sabari basin.==

**The River Valleys** 

* The Valley of the Mahanadi 
* The Valley of the Brahmani 
* The Valley of the Vamsadhara
