Suppose an industry is characterized by the following three conditions : (i) there are a large number of small firms, each producing a differentiated product and facing a downward sloping demand curve; (ii) each firm ignores the effects of tis action on the decisions taken by other firms; and (iii) new firms producing close substitutes for the product of the existing firms can enter the industry. Then derive the equilibrium conditions of an individual firm and of the industry. (2013)
