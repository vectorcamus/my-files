What are the determinants of the individual’s demand for holding money?

Would the New Classical economists advocate any particular policy intervention when the economy is in such a situation? (2013)                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 32. Macroeconomics is usually approached via the outcomes of economic interaction in the following four mark–commodities, money, bonds, and labour markets. The Classical economists focused on which three of these four markets? In which market does the loanable fund theory of interest rate determination of the Classical economists focus and how is the interest rate determined? The Neo Classical synthesis focuses on which three markets? In which market is the interest rate primarily determined in the liquidity preference theory? (2013) |
