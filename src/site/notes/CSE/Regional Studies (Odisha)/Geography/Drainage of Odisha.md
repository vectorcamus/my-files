All the rivers of Orissa are **primarily peninsular rivers** and have taken their origin from three important sources & are **non-perennial** in character

> 1. ==Chota Nagpur plateau==
> 2. ==Amarkantak plateau==
> 3. ==Eastern Ghats==


## ==1.Rivers from the Chota Nagpur Plateau== 

### The Subarnarekha

* originated from the southern slopes of the Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand and flows for a considerable distance in West Bengal and for a very short stretch it forms the boundary between Orissa and West Bengal.
* it re-enters Orissa at **Lakshmannath** slightly to the north-east of Jaleshwar
* has an ~estuarine mouth~ because of the daily tides. 
* disastrous floods to its lower reaches

### The Brahmani

* origin from the southern slopes of the Chota Nagpur Plateau
* enters Odisha in the Sundergarh district
* two major tributaries, the **Sankh** and the **Koel**
* Both these meet at **Vedavyas** near Rourkela and form the main trunk stream of the Brahmani further down.
* It has a north-south course from Rourkela to Talcher and has formed a gorge at Rengali, south of Barkot, where its water is going to be harnessed for irrigation and hydel power.
* In the Sankh, the **Mandira dam** is a detention reservoir, meant for supplying water to the Rourkela Steel Plant and the steel township.
* From Talcher down- stream, the river has changed its north-south course and has started flowing from north-north-west to south-south-east till Hindol Road.
* Then it has taken a north-north-east course till Bhuban from where it has started to flow in almost west-east direction to meet the Bay of Bengal at Wheeler Islands and Dharma.
* a total length of 701 km.
* delta starts from Jenapur in Cuttack district where it has been split into two major streams, the Brahmani and its distributary the Kharusuan.

* From the apex of the delta to the mouth, its length is 149 km.

* Its right bank distributary meets the Birupa, a left bank distributary of the Mahanadi at Indupur. 

* Mahanadi and the Brahmani have a common outlet for their flood water through Maipura and they have formed the Wheeler Islands

* has cut right across the Eastern Ghats and formed a minor gorge at Rengali.

## 2.Rivers from the Amarkantak Plateau 

### The Mahanadi

* enters Orissa near Padigan.

* It has taken a course mostly in a north-west-north to south-east-south direction in Madhya Pradesh.

* At Hirakud, the longest dam in the country has been built over the Mahanadi and an artificial lake has been created which stretches upstream for about 52.8 km from Hirakud.

* net irrigable area is 35,486 hectares and ultimate installed capacity is 4,75,000 kW of hydel power

* From Sambalpur downstream up to Sonapur, the course of the Mahanadi is almost north-south and in this section a number of tributaries meet the Mahanadi on its right bank. The most important among these are the Jira and the Jhaun which drain the Baragarh Plains.

* At Sonapur, the Tel, the largest tributary of the Mahanadi, drains to the Mahanadi on its right bank.

* From here up to Boudh the Mahanadi has a perfect west-east course while from Boudh till Banki it has a north-west-north to south- east-south course. In this portion, the Mahanadi crosses right through the Eastern Ghats and has formed a gorge at Satkosia where it has cut through the rock strata of the Eastern Ghats.

* The river enters the plain stage at Naraj in Cuttack district where initially it meets the old shoreline of the Bay of Bengal before the formation of the delta
* From this point bifurcation of the main trunk stream starts and the delta stage begins. At Naraj, many river islands have been formed and the first bifur- cation gave birth to the river Kathjodi, and from the Mahanadi at Cuttack, the Birupa took off from its left bank. At this stage, anicuts have been constructed at Jobra over the Mahanadi, over Birupa and at Naraj.

* The river has a total length of 852.8 km from its source to the delta head and 107 km from its upper point of the delta to the delta mouth

* mouth. Further downstream, the Mahanadi is bifurcat- ed into a number of distributaries and the Kathjodi bifurcates into Kuakhai. Further downstream, the Kuakhai divides into the Daya and Bhargavi.

* The Daya and Bhargavi drain into Chilka lake while all others drain into the Bay of Bengal.
### Rivers Originating from the Mahanadi Delta

* slow and sluggish in nature as the slope value between their source and mouth is negligible

* Samolia, Gobari, Prachi, Kadua, Dhanua, Ratnachira and Nuna. 

* The Samolia originates from Haripur village and flows straight to the Bay of Bengal in an easterly course. Its' bed is silted up and it fails to carry the flood waters effectively.

* The Gobari originates from Devidola and joins the Devi near Bandasahi.

* The Prachi originally branched off from the Kuakhai

* but its head has been silted up and hence closed. Now it flows from Phulnakhara and drains the area between the Kandal and the Kushabhadra rivers.

* The Kadua drains the interfluve be- tween the Prachi and the Kushabhadra.

* The Dhanua, another 

* small river, originates near Balipatna and after flowing for about 25 km. drains to the Kushabhadra

* The Ratnachira has its origin near Mukundapur village and flows in a south-west direction. It drains to the Bhargavi.

* The Nuna rises near the Ghoradiha hills and drains into the Daya near Sahupara.

### Rivers originating from the Kendujhar Plateau 

### The Baitarani

* only major river to originate from the Kendujhar Plateau.

* Guptaganga Pahar of Janghira-Dhenkikote region,

* average elevation of about 600 metres and a maximum elevation a of 668 metres.

* number of minor tributaries which originate at various elevations from a region bounded by Janghira in north-west, Dhenkikote in the north-east, Ghatagan in the south-east and Nandona in the south-west.

* total lengh of 344 km.

* The principal tributaries of the Baitarani are the Deo and Indrani.

* It flows by the side of Anandapur, the subdivisional headquarters of Kendujhar district

* Another peculiarity of the Baitarani is that in its lower reaches it drains into the distribu- taries of the Brahmani, south of Chandbali, and has a common mouth to the Bay of Bengal at Dhamra.

* average slope of 26 metres per kilometre of valley long profile. Thus, its erosive capacity is quite high due to high slope values and high rainfall (above 150 cm) in the Kendujhar Plateau. 

## 3.Rivers originating from the Eastern Slopes of the Eastern Ghats

* small in their valley long profiles and have a much steeper gradient

* they reach their base level of erosion within a short length of flow as the Eastern Ghats approach the sea on the coast of Chilika lake.

### The Burhabalanga

* Burhabalanga, in Mayurbhanj district, takes its origin from the Similipal massif to the south of the Smilipal Garh, which has an elevation of 1,082 metres near Khajuri.

* This massif has a maximum elevation of 1,165 metres at the Meghasani, and the Burhabalanga drains into the Bay of Bengal off the Baleshwar coast, slightly to the north of Chandipur.

* It flows past the two district headquarter towns of Baripada and Baleshwar.

* It has a maximum length of 175 km.

* aver- age slope per kilometre is 6.5 metres

* its erosive capacity is quite high because of higher slope values and in the Similipal massif the average rainfall exceeds 150 cm., thus, the Baripada plateau is highly eroded. 

### The Salandi

a small hill stream which originates in the southern slopes of the Similipal massif at the Meghasani mountain which has an elevation of 1,165 metres.

flows past Bhadrak, a district headquarter of Bhadrak district

harnessed for irrigation purposes at Hadagarh and the project is called the Salandi Project.

The river, after flowing for 140 km does not directly drain into the Bay of Bengal through an independent mouth of its own, but discharges its water into the Baitarani a few kilometres upstream of Chandbali. 

### Other Streams:

* of small but rapid streams to the south of the Mahanadi delta which drain into the Chilka lake.

* The average length of these streams is 30 kilometres, and the average height of the Eastern Ghats in this part is 500 metres.

* Thus, the per kilometre gradient is 17 metres, which is very high, as compared to many other rivers of Orissa. Thus, they are turbulent and dry up soon after the rainy season. All these rivers are silting up Chilika lake from the west. 

* rivers have their origin in the eastern slopes of the Eastern Ghats.

### The Rushikulya

* has a well-developed catchment basin but has failed to develop a delta in its lower reaches due to the strong offshore long current at its mouth.

* almost pear-shaped with a well-developed dendritic tributary system. T

* The major tributaries are the Dhanai, the Baghua and the Mahanadi on its left bank, and the Patama and the Ghodahada on its right bank.

* The most important of these is the Mahanadi which meets the Rushikulya at Asika.

* Most of them have their source in the common interfluves of the Tel, the Mahanadi and the Vamsadhara.

* The Rushikulya has been har- nessed from a very long time (1868) for irrigation, and detention reservoirs have been created at Sorada and Bhanjanagar.

* The plains of Ganjam are irrigated by a network of contour canals. 

* The crest height of the Eastern Ghats at the source of the Rushikulya is 1,223 metres near Sikaketta.

* The water divide varies from 600 to 1,200 metres in elevation.

* The maximum heights have been reached at Singaraju (1,500 metres), Mahendragiri (1,500 metres) and Devagiri (1,360 metres).

* These mountains form the main range of the Eastern Ghats.

* The drain- age pattern is a typical dendritic type.

* into the Bay of Bengal near Ganjam town.

==**Other River Originating from Eastern Ghats**==

- as they mostly flow in the hilly tracts of the Eastern Ghats, within Orissa for short distances and in Andhra Pradesh for longer distances

### The Bahuda

source in the Singaraju Parbat near Andanda, having an eleva- tion of about 1,516 metres

It drains into the Bay of Bengal at Icchapur marsh in Andhra Pradesh. 

### The Vamsadhara

* The Vamsadhara drains the Gunupur plateau between Rayagarh and Paralakhemundi

* Paralakhemundi. It has its source to the west of Durgapanga which has an elevation of 763 metres

* The river has a number of minor tributaries which meet the main trunk stream on its left and right banks. These are relatively unimportant as they are mostly hill streams and are of very little use to agriculture.

* The Vamsadhara drains into the Bay of Bengal, at Kalingapatanam in Andhra Pradesh

* It has a total length of 230 km, of which only 150 km is in Orissa. 

### The Nagavali:

* The Nagavali is another inter-State river which has its source in Orissa and flows for a considerable distance in Andhra Pradesh, before draining into the Bay of Bengal south of Srikakulam.
![nagavali.png](/img/user/CSE/Regional%20Studies%20(Odisha)/Images/Drainage%20of%20Odisha(Images)/nagavali.png)

* It has its source south of Lanjigarh in old Koraput district.

* The most important town by its side is Rayagarh.

* Through this valley the railway line linking Vizianagaram with Raipur, crosses the Eastern Ghats.

* It has a total length of 210 km, of which 100 km are in Orissa and the rest in Andhra Pradesh. 



### The Godavari System

* The Godavari system consists of the tributaries of the Godavari. The main is Sileru, which meets the Godavari on its left bank near Kunavaram.

* The Sileru and the Sabari meet at Motu, the extreme south-west point of Orissa

* Incidentally, the Sileru forms the south-eastern border and the Sabari the south-western border of Orissa in Malkargiri district. 

* The Machhakund (the name of the Sileru in its upper reaches) has been harnessed for generating hydel power. The Machhakund hydro-electric scheme is a joint project of the Governments of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh with an installed capacity of 114.75 MW. Orissa gets 30 per cent of its share, amounting to 34 MW.

* The Balimela reservoir has been created to generate hydel power from the Sileru.

* The Poteru is a second-order stream which has also been harnessed to irrigate the interfluve areas between the Sileru and the Sabari, popularly known as the Malkangiri-Motu uplands.

* Bangladesh. All these rivers flow in a north-north- east to south-south-west direction and drain the Malkangiri district. 

![kolab sabri.png](/img/user/CSE/Regional%20Studies%20(Odisha)/Images/Drainage%20of%20Odisha(Images)/kolab%20sabri.png)
* The Indravati, another tributary of the Godavari, flows in an east-west direction and drains the Nabarangpur uplands. 

* This river is being harnessed to irrigate the parched uplands which traditionally suffer from drought and also to generate hydel power.

## 4.Other Water Bodies

### Lakes

* The most important among the natural lakes are Chilika, Sar, Samagara and Ansupa.
![artificial reservoirs.png](/img/user/CSE/Regional%20Studies%20(Odisha)/Images/Drainage%20of%20Odisha(Images)/artificial%20reservoirs.png)

![Screenshot 2024-07-13 at 5.25.00 PM 1.png](/img/user/CSE/Regional%20Studies%20(Odisha)/Images/Drainage%20of%20Odisha(Images)/Screenshot%202024-07-13%20at%205.25.00%20PM%201.png)
* The Chilika Lake is  brackish water lagoon located in the southern part of the Odisha coastal plain. It is India's largest coastal lagoon and spread across the districts of Ganjam, Khurda and Puri. Its area varies 900 km and 1165 km during the two monsoon months it is 71 km long and 32 km wide. Its salinity decreases to a minimum during the monsoon. However, in winter, due to the overflow of the tidal water through the narrow opening from the Bay of Bengal, the lake reaches its maximum height. It is a Ramsar Convention protected wetland and hosts around 33 species of migratory and local birds.
* Anshupa is a fresh water horseshoe lake located at Athagarh in Cuttack district within the alluvial plain of river Mahanadi. It is 3 km long and 1.5 km wide.
* **Sara** is a fresh water lake located near Puri. It is 5 km long and 3 km wide. Four distributaries of Mahanadi River system, the Bhargavi, the Kushabhadra, the Mugei and the Dhanua drain into the lake.
* Kanjia lake is another fresh water lake with about 134 acres (0.54 km) of area located in Nandankanan of Khorda district near Bhubaneswar.
* **Tampara** is another fresh water lake located alongside the town of Chatrapur. It is 4 km long and 0.5 km wide. It is feed by the backwater of Rushikulya river in monsoon season.

### Tidal Rivers

* confined to the lower reaches of the rivers in the Orissa coastal plain. 

* The tidal channels vary from a maximum of 90 km and in the case of Brahmani to a minimum of 5 km, in the case of Baghuni from their respective mouths.

* The Mahanadi is tidal for about 35 km whereas the Devi, a distributary of the Mahanadi, is tidal for 45 km.

### Springs and Hot Springs

* The springs have mostly developed on the eastern and western slopes of the Eastern Ghats due to heavy rainfall on the one hand and the hard Gondwana gneissic rocks as the bedrock on the other.

* The rate of percolation being limited,

* of springs are also low compared to the extent of the Eastern Ghats

### Hot Springs 

* Deulijhara near Athamallik on the flood-plains of the Mahanadi. 

* Atri near Khordha which is a famous tourist spot.

* eastern slopes of the Eastern Ghats at Taptapani in Ganjam district.
