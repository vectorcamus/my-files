18. Suppose a given yield of tax is to be obtained from an excise on a particular product in a perfectly competitive industry.

Demonstrate your answer with a diagram. (2013) 
19. What is rent seeking? Consider a proposal by a government to levy a proportional tax on income so as to subsidize the consumption of a good. The proportional tax at rate t reduces the wage received t w(1–t) which with a standard upward sloping supply of labour curve will reduce the ours of labours worked from say L2 to L1 . The net income of the person falls and tax revenue will be 1 twL . This is transferred as a subsidy which reduces the price of the subsidized good from P to P – S and increases the quantity demanded from Q1 to Q2 . What is the valuation of the subsidy by the recipient? Is it equal to the value of taxes paid to finance the subsidy? If the tax payer decides to devote resources to rent seeking to forestall the policy to subsidize the good and the subsidy recipient is also willing to devote resources to encourage the adoption of the policy, who will have the advantage in the rent seeking context.?
